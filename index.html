 - Fixed all arches/small arches recipes conflicts !<span class="br">
<span class="br">
<span class="br">
<h3><strong>v0.6 Changelog :</strong></h3>
 - Added triangle ramps (aka small ramps) : These are 1 block-wide double-sided ramps that can connect to bigger ramps (check the Images)<span class="br">
 - Added small arches : These are 1 block-wide full (half-circle) arches<span class="br">
 - Modified ramps : They can't connect anymore to stairs but they can now connect better to other types of ramps<span class="br">
 - Fixed some language mistakes<span class="br">
 - Compacted some parts of the code to make the file smaller<span class="br">

I really hope this mod will be appreciated !<span class="br">
