        <h1>Welcome on Mo'Blocks Official Wiki</h1>
        <p><h2><strong>Mo'Blocks is a simple mod that adds random decorative and useful blocks.</strong></h2>

This mod is currently in 1.14.4 and it needs forge to work.<span class="br">

<h4 style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">Be Careful :</h4><span class="br">
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">Optifine doesn't like Mo'Blocks, as it adds thousands and thousands of models and optifine doesn't appreciate that</p><br />
