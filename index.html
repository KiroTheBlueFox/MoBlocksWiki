        <h1>Welcome on Mo'Blocks Official Wiki</h1>
        
        <p><h2><strong>Mo'Blocks is a simple (unfinished) mod that adds random decorative and useful blocks.</strong></h2><br />
Currently being worked on by KiroTheBlueFox, Mo'Blocks adds various blocks to the game, such as ramps, archs or even pillars !<br />
<br />
This mod is currently in 1.14.4 and it needs forge to work.<br />

<h3>It will help me for some future stuff !<br />
I'll let you all wonder about it !<br />
The first teaser will be shared when the Redstone Update (v0.7) will be released !</h3><br />
<br />
<br />
<h3><strong>v0.6b Changelog :</strong></h3><br />
 - Fixed all arches/small arches recipes conflicts !<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3><strong>v0.6 Changelog :</strong></h3><br />
 - Added triangle ramps (aka small ramps) : These are 1 block-wide double-sided ramps that can connect to bigger ramps (check the Images)<br />
 - Added small arches : These are 1 block-wide full (half-circle) arches<br />
 - Modified ramps : They can't connect anymore to stairs but they can now connect better to other types of ramps<br />
 - Fixed some language mistakes<br />
 - Compacted some parts of the code to make the file smaller<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm new to modding so maybe there will be some glitches with certain blocks.<br />
<br />
I really hope this mod will be appreciated !<br />
<strong>Any feedback, critic, custom block requests/suggestions or anything else is welcomed !</strong></p>
